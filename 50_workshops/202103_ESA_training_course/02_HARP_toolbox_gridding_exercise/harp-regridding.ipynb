    "This practical will show you how to read and visualize data from Earth Observation data products by making use of the [ESA Atmospheric Toolbox](https://atmospherictoolbox.org/).\n",
    "The toolbox consists of four components which are CODA, HARP, VISAN, and QDOAS. In this exercise we will be focusing primarily on HARP.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way to demonstrate the HARP functionality is with the VISAN application that is part of the Atmospheric Toolbox. However, this application can only be run locally on a Desktop.\n",
    "For this reason, we have chosen this time to demonstrate how to use the HARP functionality within a Jupyter Notebook. This can be run remotely on a server and accessed via a web browser. However, you can also still run this locally as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the visualisations we will make use of the matplotlib and cartopy libraries. Although there are both advantages and disadvantages of using matplotlib compared to the visualisations that VISAN provides, we will not go into detail on this within this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the steps below we will provide a basic data reading and visualization introduction and then demonstrate the creation of a daily L3 grid file from one day of Sentinel-5P L2 NO2 products. Finally, we will provide a use case for looking at the NO2 pollution in the Mediterranean region."

HARP really performs an _import_ and converts the data from the original Sentinel-5P L2 format to a structure that is compatible with the HARP conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This conversion mainly consists of renaming of variables, restructuring the dimensions, and leaving out the 'less important' variables. HARP has builtin converters for [a lot of atmospheric data products](http://stcorp.github.io/harp/doc/html/ingestions/index.html). For each conversion the HARP documentation contains a description of the variables it will return and how it mapped them from the original product format. The description for the product that we ingested can be found in the [S5P_L2_NO2](http://stcorp.github.io/harp/doc/html/ingestions/S5P_L2_NO2.html) description.\n",
